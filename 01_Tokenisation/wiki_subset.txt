I just got back from the store and picked up some milk, eggs, and bread. I also grabbed a few apples and some yogurt for breakfast tomorrow.

My coworker said she was running late because she had to drop her kids off at school before coming into the office.

I'm planning on going to the gym after work, but I'm not sure if I'll have enough energy. I had a long day at the office and am feeling pretty tired.

The doctor told me to take two pills a day and to make sure I drink plenty of water. I also need to avoid certain foods that could interfere with the medication.

My friend invited me to go to the movies with her tonight, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it. I have a lot of work to do and need to finish up some projects before the end of the day.

Mr.John's package should arrive tomorrow. The tracking info says it's been delivered to the post office and is out for delivery and it should be delivered by 5PM.

My boss asked me to send him a copy of the report by the end of the day. I'll need to print it out and then scan it so I can email it to him.

I'm not sure what to wear to the party on Saturday. It's supposed to be pretty casual, but I don't want to look too sloppy.

I think I left my keys in the car. I'm not sure if I locked the doors or not. I'll have to check when I get home.

The weather forecast says it's going to rain tomorrow, so I'll need to bring an umbrella with me to work. 

I have a meeting with my boss at 10:00 a.m. on Friday.

The flight from LAX to JFK is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday.
